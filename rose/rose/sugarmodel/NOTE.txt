REQUIREMENTS:
This model is written in python 2.7 and uses recents versions of scipy, numpy et matplotlib.
To install all of these modules, you can install the miniconda distribution :
https://conda.io/miniconda.html
and create an environment
>>> conda create -n rose python=2 scipy matplotlib
that can be activated and used to play the model
>>> [source] activate rose
>>> python diagram.py

UTIL:
- defaultparameters.py : A module that implement a mechanism to declare names and default values of parameters using initialization functions 
- params_generate.py   : Methods to regenerate a parameter file with updated values.
- runmodel.py          : Function to execute a model with given parameters.

OPTIMIZATION:
- targets.py           : Observed values of compounds or delay used for the optimization.

MODEL DEFINITION:
- model-paper.py      : equations of the model described in the paper
- parameters-paper.py : values of the parameters of the model described in the paper.
- model-directsugar-paper.py : equations of the alternative model described in the paper with direct action of sugar on I.
- parameters-directsugar-paper.py : values of the parameters of the model with direct action of sugar on I.
- model_general.py : some general equations used in the model that are not optimized.

MAIN:
- diagram.py : Plot functions of the model. It can called with following options:
    -m : set the model to plot (ex: -m model-directsugar-paper.py).
    -t : print a table of resulting values of simulations for different conditions.
    CK|SL|I|ALL : plot the values of the specified compound.
    no option : plot a composed diagram of the different compounds.

- optimize.py : Optimize th parameter of a model. It can called with following options:
    -m : set the model to optimize (ex: -m model-directsugar-paper.py)
    -r : with random seed. A number of random initial parameter values will be used to start the optimization. If this option is not enabled, the current parameter value will be used as starting point.
    -w : characterize variability of random seed.
    CK|SL|I|ALL : optimize the parameters of the specified compound.
    default : optimize I with all conditions (including burst delay inference).
