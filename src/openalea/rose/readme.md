# Rose Measurement with Polhemus 

Axis orientation in the case of acquisition with the Polhemus:

* z is directed downward
* x: to the left
* y: to the back

The plant is oriented towards -x

After rotating the plant 180Â° around the y-axis:
the plant is oriented towards +x

This is quite good because, with this, all the plants face +x on the tablet
